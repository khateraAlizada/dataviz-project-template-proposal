# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is from https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Age-and-Gender. Personal health care (PHC) for difference services( 'Dental Services', 'Durable Medical Equipment', 'Home Health Care', 'Hospital Care', 'Nursing Care Facilities and Continuing Care Retirement Communities', 'Other Health Residential and Personal Care', 'Other Nondurable Medical Products', 'Other Professional Services', 'Physician and Clinical Services', 'Prescription Drugs', 'Total Personal Health Care', 'Service')and different sources of funding (private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, out-of-pocket, and all other payers and programs) is available for five age groups: 0-18, 19-44, 45-64, 65-84, and 85 and over, for different gender groups males and females and total for even years from 2002 through 2014.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * As time increase total per capital health expenses will increase. 
 * As population age group increases, their health expenses will also increase.
 * What is the difference between males and females per capita health spending in a given year? Children (0-18)?
 * How does male children and female children total health care expenditure differ?
 * How does working-age (19-64) males and females per capita health spending differ?
 * What percentage of health care spending accounted for females 65 and older and what percentage of 65 and older population are females?
 

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

I am not sure how to display the data from a specific population group. For example, displaying  health expenses for a given gender group, for a given service, for a given payer and a given age group in a given year. 

## Milestones

Each week I will try to focus on one task and will try to visualize it.
